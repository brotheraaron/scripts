A repo of mostly bash scripts for Azure, AKS, or containers.

Short term goal is to build a toolbox to simplify common tasks.
Long term goal build automation for common cloud infrastructures.

If your entire production environment gets wiped out after running one of these scripts, I will have sympathy, but accept no responsibility.
